<h4>To Begin The Game</h4>
<p>To start playing, click the On/Off switch. This will enable the game. You can disable it at any time by clicking again to turn it off.</p>
<p>To start a new game, click the "Start" button. If at any time you want to restart play with a new game, you can click the button again.</p>

<h4>Game Play</h4>
<p>The game will display one of the colors by lighting up that color. When the display finishes, copy the color displayed by clicking that color. The game will then duplicate that color and add one more. Again, once the display is finished, copy the pattern by clicking the correct two colors in sequence.</p>
<p>The game will continue to add colors one at a time to the sequence. The number of colors in the current sequence will be shown on the "Count" screen. Continue to copy the given pattern exactly by clicking on the colors in sequence.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake, or if you take longer than 5 seconds to go, the game will display the current pattern again (unless in strict mode, see below). You can keep trying until you can copy it correctly.</p>
<p>The game is won after the sequence has reached 20 colors, and you have successfully copied all 20 correctly.</p>

<h4>Strict Button</h4>
<p>To make the game more challenging, you can play in strict mode. Click the "Strict" button to turn strict mode on/off. If the light above the button is lit, strict mode is on.</p>
<p>In strict mode, as soon as you make a single mistake, or if you take too long to go (more than 5 seconds), the game is over, and a new game begins.</p>
